How it works:
+------------+
Run Main.py.
It reads the board specified in 'DefaultLayout.txt',
then output the steps in the format of:

 #{Index of Piece} {Direction}: {(Current Board Layout)}

 e.g.
 ...
 #7 UP: (3, 19, 10, 9, 0, 12, 2, 13, 15, 7)
 #8 DOWN: ...
 ...

How to write your own layout file:
+--------------------------------+
The layout file contains the coordinate of each block. It is organized as follows:
-- BEGINNING OF FILE --
TypeLetter
Coordinate
Coordinate
...
TypeLetter
Coordinate
Coordinate
...

...
-- END OF FILE --

'TypeLetter' is a single capital letter that specifies which type of piece the next few coordinates define,
until another TypeLetter is encountered. It can be either B(ig), H(orizontal), V(ertical) or S(mall).

'Coordinate' is a two number group in the order of 'X Y' (0 based). It represents the coordinate of the
LEFT-TOP block of a piece.

For example, the following file:

B
1 0
H
1 2
2 3

defines a 2x2 piece whose LEFT-TOP block is at (1,0),
and two 1x2 pieces whose LEFT-TOP blocks are at(1,2), and (2, 3) respectively.

So the resulting board would look (E = empty block):

E 0 0 E
E 0 0 E
E 1 1 E
E E 1 1
E E E E

FAQ:
+--+
Why the 'HR' prefix for all class files?

  HR is the acronym of the Chinese name of Klotski -- Hua-Rong Dao (The Path of Hua-Rong).
  In the Chinese version, the game reenacts a classical story where the warlord, Cao Cao,
  escaped to the path of Hua-Rong after defeated in the Battle of Red Cliff. There he was
  ambushed by the enemy general Guan Yu. Each piece is assigned with a name of a historical
  figure, with the 2x2 piece being Cao Cao, and the horizontal one Guan Yu.
